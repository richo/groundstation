INSTALLATION GUIDE

This guide assumes you want to install system-wide, without pip. The
recommended install is still with virtualenv and pip.

This guide comes with no warrenty or assurance of correctness.  It's mostly meant as a guideline.
Your milage may vary.  Many commands assume you have (or can get) root priveldges.  Good luck!
